# RailrushAndroid
This is a client Android app which displays the CROWD COUNT (number of peoples present) in the train, at which station the train was last seen at and also other info such as starting and destination station of each train
The trains data is offline apart from CROWD COUNT and last station which is fethed from the server which is hosted on an EC2 
The code for the server is also present in my other Repository named Railrush
